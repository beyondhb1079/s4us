        I am a DACA recipient currently working as a software engineer. I came
        up with this project idea after participating in the{' '}
        <MuiLink href="http://beyondhb1079.org/">Beyond HB 1079</MuiLink> team
        and noticing how painful it is to find scholarships and compile a list
        for undocumented students. My hope is to make this the go-to resource
        for scholarships for undocumented students.

        DreamScholars aims to make it easier for undocumented students to pay
        for school. Our mission is to remove the financial barriers that prevent
        and discourage undocumented students from pursuing higher education due
        to the difficulties of finding scholarships they qualify for.

        Meet the team behind DreamScholars. We are a group of lifelong learners
        who are passionate about technology and community upliftment. The
        project arose from our own struggles as students and the lack of
        resources for our community.
