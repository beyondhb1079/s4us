        I am a DACA recipient currently working as a software engineer. I came
        up with this project idea after participating in the{' '}
        <MuiLink href="http://beyondhb1079.org/">Beyond HB 1079</MuiLink> team
        and noticing how painful it is to find scholarships and compile a list
        for undocumented students. My hope is to make this the go-to resource
        for scholarships for undocumented students.
