# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# In this case: build, lint, and test
jobs:
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      # Sets up node
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '12'
          check-latest: true

      # Build the app
      - run: yarn install
      - run: yarn build --frozen-lockfile
  
  lint:
